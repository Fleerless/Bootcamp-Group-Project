# Bootcamp-Group-Project | What's Hot?

DESCRIPTION: Have you ever been on vacation, wanted to get brunch at the best spot in town, but didn't know how to begin searching? With Hot Spots you can search any city to find the part of town that has everything you're looking for, and you can follow your nose to a 5-star brunch!

MOTIVATION: At Hot Spots, we wanted to take a fresh look at the world of restaurant and entertainment mapping. There are all sorts of apps that will take you to your favorite restaurant, but no one tells you where the hottest spots that have everything you're looking for, all in close proximity.

RESULTS: So we developed an app that will let you search any city (some restrictions apply), for anything from Brunch to Clubs, and you will be presented with a map, showing where all the Hot Spots are, all you have to do is pick one, and start exploring!
